            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a Senior Agile Business Analyst with over 10 years of experience helping organisations turn complex problems into clear, actionable solutions that deliver real customer and business value.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked across loyalty, banking, and ecommerce – including Qantas Loyalty, Westpac, and WooliesX – leading digital delivery across both mobile and web. I’m hands-on with backlog management, user story writing, and stakeholder workshops, but also focused on unblocking delivery, improving squad velocity, and building strong relationships with cross-functional teams.</p>
            <p>I actively use tools like Miro, Jira, and Figma, along with AI (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT) to accelerate analysis, sharpen documentation, and close feedback loops faster.</p>
            <p>I bring a calm, collaborative approach, and thrive in fast-paced environments where curiosity, clarity, and delivery matter. My dedication to simplicity and reliability helps achieve top-tier project results.</p>
